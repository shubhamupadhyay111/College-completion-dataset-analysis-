# College-completion-dataset-analysis-
This project analyzes college completion metrics, exploring graduation rates, financial aid, and institutional factors. Using statistical and visual methods, it examines correlations, state-wise variations, and college-type impacts.

To provide a detailed analysis of this project, I’ll break down each component based on the notebook's structure and summarize the insights from the headings and content. Let’s start with an in-depth look at the data analysis process and the insights being targeted.

### **Detailed Analysis: College Completion Dataset**

#### 1. **Dataset Introduction**
- **Purpose:** Provides an overview of the dataset.  
- **Contents Likely Included:**
  - Dataset structure: columns, data types, and key variables.
  - High-level statistics (e.g., number of rows, missing values).
  - Important columns include `student_count`, `on_time_graduate`, `aid_value`, and `state`.

#### 2. **Key Questions Analyzed**
The notebook systematically addresses the following questions, each tied to a specific aspect of college completion:

1. **What is the average graduation rate (`on_time_graduate`) across all colleges?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Descriptive statistics: mean, median, and distribution of `on_time_graduate`.
     - Visualization (e.g., histogram or box plot) for graduation rate patterns.

2. **Is there a correlation between student count (`student_count`) and the on-time graduation rate?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Scatter plot to visualize relationships.
     - Correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson’s r) to measure strength and direction.

3. **How does average financial aid (`aid_value`) vary across states?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Grouping data by state.
     - Bar or box plots to display variations in financial aid.

4. **What is the distribution of expenditure on awards (`spent_award_value`) for colleges?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Histogram for distribution.
     - Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and outliers).

5. **Is there a relationship between full-time student percentage (`fulltime_student_per`) and on-time graduation rate?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Scatter plot for visual patterns.
     - Regression analysis to assess linear relationships.

6. **Which state has the highest average awards per 100 students (`awards_per_100_value`)?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Aggregation of award metrics by state.
     - Identifying and ranking states based on averages.

7. **How does college control (`control`) influence on-time graduation rates?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Comparing public vs. private institutions.
     - Visualization (e.g., box plots) to highlight differences.

8. **Is there a relationship between college type (`colllage_type`) and average retention rates?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Categorizing colleges by type and analyzing retention rates.
     - Statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to assess significance.

9. **What is the average student count (`student_count`) for colleges in each state?**
   - Likely involves:
     - Aggregating by state and calculating averages.
     - Bar charts or maps for visualization.

10. **Which colleges have the highest average awards per 100 students (`awards_per_100_value`)?**
    - Likely involves:
      - Identifying top-performing institutions based on award metrics.

#### 3. **Analysis Methodology**
**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and bar charts.  
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Correlation coefficients.
  - Regression models.
  - Group comparisons using statistical tests.

**Visualizations:**
- State-level comparisons and financial aid distributions.
- College control (public/private) vs. graduation rates.
- Scatter plots for correlation analysis.

---

#### 4. **Conclusion**
The project likely summarizes findings for each question. Potential insights include:
- States or college types associated with higher graduation rates.
- Key financial or demographic factors influencing student success.
- Patterns in expenditure and awards.

### **Additional Suggestions**
To enhance this project further:
1. **Advanced Analysis:** Include predictive modeling (e.g., linear regression or machine learning) to predict graduation rates based on key factors.
2. **Visualization Enhancements:** Interactive plots (e.g., with Plotly) for better exploration.
3. **Insights Communication:** Add actionable recommendations for policymakers or college administrators.
